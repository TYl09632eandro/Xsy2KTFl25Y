A simple web scraper tool using Python and NumPy.
# NOTE: 重要实现细节

This tool is designed to fetch web content from a given URL.
It uses the requests library for sending HTTP requests and BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content.
The NumPy library is used for numerical operations if needed, although it's not essential for this task.
